## Pre-merge TODOs

- [x] Fix the per-area CFP page layout
- [x] Fix weird sizes for lists
    - Hafl-way solved: the issue is that p and il item sizes are defined proportionaly to the parent. So if they are nested, they get scalled multiple times and get smaller and smaller.
    - Fixed by tweeking the css
- [x] Get the latest bib
- [x] finish the "contributing" page.

    - student reviewers

    - instruction for reviewers page?

- Consider moving the "reviewing process" to info for authors (it's not really a policy)
- [ ] Endogeny to compute and display
    - The proportion of published papers where at least one of the authors is an editor, editorial board member or reviewer must not exceed 20% based on the research content of the latest two issues.
